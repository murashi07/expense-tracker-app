## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Data Storage:** The app uses a local SQLite database managed through the `sqflite` package to persistently store all user data, including expenses, budgets, and savings goals.

2.  **Expense Tracking:** Users can manually input their expenses, categorizing them and specifying the amount, date, and an optional description. These entries are stored in the SQLite database.

3.  **Budget Management:** Users can set monthly budgets for different categories. The app tracks spending within each category and can trigger local notifications (using `flutter_local_notifications`) when a user is approaching or exceeding their budget.

4.  **Savings Goals:** Users can define savings goals with a target amount and a deadline. The app allows users to track their progress toward these goals, providing motivation and reminders.

5.  **Reporting:** The `fl_chart` package is used to generate charts and graphs that visually represent the user's spending habits, budget status, and progress toward savings goals.

6.  **User Interface:** The user interface is built using Flutter widgets, providing a smooth and responsive experience. Animations and transitions (using the `animations` package) enhance the overall user experience.

7.  **Offline Functionality:** Because all data is stored locally in the SQLite database, the app functions fully even when the device is offline.
